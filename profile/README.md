# ✨ Nyanro

**Nyanro** is a Y2K-inspired creator discovery hub for indie streamers and content creators.

Our goal is simple:  
Help small-to-mid-sized creators get discovered before they hit it big — and give fans a chance to say, *“I was here first.”*

## 🔍 What is Nyanro?

Nyanro is an early-stage project focused on:

- 🌱 Tiering creators by follower/viewer count across platforms (Twitch, TikTok, X, etc)
- 📈 Making it easy for fans to find new and rising talent
- 🎨 Blending slick modern UX with nostalgic Y2K themes

## 🚧 Status

We’re in early development. Join our waitlist at [nyanro.netlify.app](https://https://nyanro.netlify.app/) *(real domain coming soon!)* or follow the journey.
